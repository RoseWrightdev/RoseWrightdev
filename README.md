# Hi, I'm Rose! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a rising sophomore at [the University of Minnesota Twin Cities: College of Science & Engineering]([url](https://cse.umn.edu/)), double majoring in Computer Science & Data Science.

This summer, I'm developing at the College of Liberal Arts, full-stack in Next.js with Shadcn, and Google Apps Script.


I'm focusing on contributing to and updating these projects:

- Kubernetes Gateway API

- Minerva.Studio CI/CD

- Rose Programming Language

- RoseWright.dev
