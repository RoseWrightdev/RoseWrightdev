# Hi, I'm Rose! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a rising sophomore at [the University of Minnesota Twin Cities: College of Science & Engineering]([url](https://cse.umn.edu/)), double majoring in Computer Science & Data Science.

This summer, I'm working 30 hours a week at the College of Liberal Arts on JavaScript automation in Google Workspaces, accessibility, and content editing. 

I'm focusing on contributing to and updating these projects:

- Kubernetes GatewayAPI

- Minerva CI/CD Provider

- Social Media App

- Rose Programming Language

- RoseWright.dev
